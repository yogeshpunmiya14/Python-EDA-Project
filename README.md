**NVIDIA Stock Volatility Analysis (2014‚Äì2024)üìä**

**Overview**
This project conducts Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on NVIDIA's stock price volatility over the past decade (2014‚Äì2024). Using historical stock data, we analyze key financial trends, volatility patterns, and risk factors to gain insights into market behavior.

**Dataset**
Source: Historical stock data from financial APIs (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, etc.).
Key variables:
Date: The trading date.
Closing Price: The final price of the stock each day.
Daily Returns: Percentage change in closing price.
